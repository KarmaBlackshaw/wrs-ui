# WRS App — Functional & Frontend Spec

Last updated: 27 Sep 2026

## 1. Overview and scope

One offline-capable web app runs the water refilling station: deliveries, walk-in sales, containers, stock, cash, expenses, payroll and loans. This doc covers the functional spec and the frontend design; the backend gets its own spec, built from section 12.

**Goals**

- Every container, peso and consumable is traceable to a person and a day.
- Riders log a delivery in a few taps, even without signal.
- The owner can run the store from one daily summary.

**In scope:** employees, customers, pricing, containers, deposits, credit, delivery trips, walk-in sales, cashier cash, consumables, maintenance, water quality, expenses, payroll, advances and loans, reports, owner digest.

**Deferred:** shifts, attendance, benefits and government contributions, per-container QR tracking, route planning.

## 2. Roles and permissions

Five roles; one employee can hold several. Only the owner approves, finalizes, or changes settings.

## 3. Global settings and defaults

Defaults live in one Settings screen; each can be overridden per employee, customer or loan. A change applies from its effective date forward and never rewrites past records.

| Setting                             | Default             | Override at       | Notes                                    |

| Customer credit limit               | TBD (₱)             | Customer          | Blocks credit sales at limit             |
| Void approval threshold             | TBD (₱)             | —                 | Above this, owner approves               |

TBD values are set by the owner at go-live; the app ships with none hard-coded.

## 4. Functional spec by module

Each module below states what it records and what it produces. Rules that cut across modules are numbered in section 5.

### 4.1 Employees

- Name, phone, roles (rider, cashier, washer, helper), active flag.
- Pay plan: frequency, base rate, rate basis (per day or per period), quota and incentive (riders). Inherits defaults; overrides are dated.

### 4.2 Customers

- Name and address only. Address is free text and may hold landmarks.
- Derived, read-only: containers held, deposit on file, credit balance, delivery history.
- Delivery history (owner view): date, rider, delivered, empties collected, amount, payment type.

### 4.3 Products and pricing

- Product: name, type (refill, container, bottled, other), container type (for refills), price, active flag.
- One price per product. A price change is dated; sales keep the price they were sold at.

### 4.4 Containers

- Types: round (delivery and walk-in), slim (walk-in only).
- Pooled counts per type, no per-unit tracking.
- Every movement is logged: purchased, to rider, to customer, collected, returned, damaged, lost, retired.
- Holdings at any time: station, each rider, each customer.
- Daily physical count at the station (full and empty, per type) against expected; variance logged.

### 4.5 Deposits

- Charged per borrowed station container, amount per type from defaults.
- Refunded on return; forfeited on loss or damage.
- Owner can waive per customer.

### 4.6 Credit (utang)

- Owner enables credit per customer and sets the limit (default from settings).
- Credit sales blocked when the sale would exceed the limit; paid in cash instead.
- Payments: full or partial, collected by cashier or rider; they count in that person's cash.
- Aging buckets: current, 7, 15, 30+ days.

### 4.7 Delivery trips

- Load-out: rider, products and quantities (round refills only for containers).
- Deliveries: customer, delivered, empties collected, amount (auto), payment type (cash, e-wallet, credit), deposit collected.
- Return: unsold full, empties, cash, payments collected.
- Reconciliation by cashier or owner: full, empties, cash. Variances become rider shortages.

### 4.8 Walk-in sales

- Product, quantity, customer (required if borrowing, credit or deposit), own or borrowed container, payment type.
- Borrowed containers (round or slim) tracked to the customer.

### 4.9 Cashier cash drawer

- Daily session: opening cash, walk-in cash, collections, drawer expenses, rider remittances, closing count.
- Variance recorded against the cashier.

### 4.10 Consumables

- Item, unit, kind (per-unit, maintenance, general), reorder level.
- Per-unit items (caps, seals) deduct automatically per refill sold, from a per-product usage list.
- Restocks come from expenses; stock-takes adjust counts with a reason.

### 4.11 Maintenance

- Filters, membrane, UV lamp: interval by liters produced and/or days.
- Production meter reading logged; replacement logged with date and meter reading.
- Due and overdue items flagged.

### 4.12 Water quality

- Daily TDS (and pH if measured) with who logged it.
- Lab tests: type, date, result, attached file, next due date.

### 4.13 Expenses

- Category (editable list), amount, date, paid by, source (drawer or owner), receipt photo.
- Consumable purchases also restock inventory.
- Payroll and loan releases post automatically.

### 4.14 Payroll

- Pay runs per frequency and period.
- Riders: base per day worked (days from reconciled trips) plus daily incentive above quota.
- Others: fixed per period plus manual adjustments.
- Deductions: advances, then loan installments, then approved shortages, within the cap.
- Finalize locks the run; corrections go in the next run as adjustments.

### 4.15 Advances and loans

- Request by employee, approved and released by owner, with signed authorization attached.
- Advance: no interest, deducted next run.
- Loan: monthly interest, flat or diminishing, term in months, installments split across pay runs.
- Early payoff waives unearned interest.

### 4.16 Reports and digest

- Reports: rider reconciliation, cashier variance, sales, credit aging, containers held, container count variance, stock and reorder, maintenance due, water quality, expenses, payroll summary, loan balances, monthly profit (sales minus expenses).
- Daily digest to owner: sales (cash and credit), collections, expenses, variances, low stock, maintenance and tests due.

## 5. Business rules

The frontend enforces these for fast feedback; the backend enforces them again as the source of truth.

| #     | Rule                                                                                                                     | Enforced on        |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| BR-01 | Slim containers can never be loaded on a trip or delivered.                                                              | Load-out, delivery |
| BR-02 | Recorded sales, deliveries, payments, counts and movements are never edited; fixes are voids or corrections.             | All records        |
| BR-03 | A void needs a reason and records who and when; above the threshold it needs owner approval.                             | Voids              |
| BR-04 | A credit sale is blocked if it takes the customer over their limit.                                                      | Delivery, walk-in  |
| BR-05 | Credit sales require the customer to be credit-enabled by the owner.                                                     | Delivery, walk-in  |
| BR-06 | Borrowing a station container requires a customer and a deposit, unless waived.                                          | Delivery, walk-in  |
| BR-07 | Deliveries are only allowed on the rider's own open trip.                                                                | Delivery           |
| BR-08 | A trip is reconciled only after all its offline entries have synced.                                                     | Reconciliation     |
| BR-09 | Reconciliation: loaded = delivered + returned full; empties collected = empties returned; cash expected = cash remitted. | Reconciliation     |
| BR-10 | Incentive counts only round containers on reconciled trips: (delivered that day − quota) × rate, floored at 0.           | Payroll            |
| BR-11 | Deductions stop at the cap; the remainder rolls to the next run.                                                         | Payroll            |
| BR-12 | Deduction order: advances, loan installments, approved shortages.                                                        | Payroll            |
| BR-13 | Shortages are recorded, never deducted unless the owner approves each one.                                               | Payroll            |
| BR-14 | A finalized pay run is read-only.                                                                                        | Payroll            |
| BR-15 | A loan is released only with a signed authorization attached.                                                            | Loans              |
| BR-16 | Early loan payoff waives interest not yet earned.                                                                        | Loans              |
| BR-17 | Price and default changes apply from their effective date; history is kept.                                              | Settings, pricing  |
| BR-18 | Selling a refill deducts its consumables from stock.                                                                     | Sales              |
| BR-19 | A consumable purchase expense restocks that consumable.                                                                  | Expenses           |
| BR-20 | Only the owner changes settings, pay plans, credit limits, deposit waivers, or finalizes payroll.                        | All                |

## 6. Frontend stack and architecture

Recommended stack: Vue 3 + TypeScript, local-first. Swap any row before building the skeleton.

| Concern              | Choice                                                          |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Framework            | Vue 3, Composition API, `<script setup>`, TypeScript            |
| Build                | Vite                                                            |
| Styling              | Tailwind CSS only; all components built in-house, no UI library |

| Offline storage      | idb (IndexedDB)                                                 |
| PWA                  | vite-plugin-pwa (Workbox)                                       |
| Forms and validation | VeeValidate + Zod                                               |
| Dates                | date-fns, fixed to Asia/Manila                                  |
| Money                | Integer centavos everywhere; format only at display             |
| Charts               | Chart.js (reports only)                                         |
| Labels               | vue-i18n, English and Filipino                                  |
| Photos               | Camera file input, compressed on device before upload           |
| Testing              | Vitest (units), Playwright (flows)                              |

```mermaid

Screens never call the network directly. Every read and write goes to the local database; the sync engine moves changes to and from the backend in the background.

## 7. Project structure

Feature folders: each module owns its views, components, store and repository. Shared code lives in `core`.

```text
src/
  app/
    main.ts
    App.vue
    router/            # routes, role guards
    layouts/           # OwnerLayout, CashierLayout, RiderLayout, StaffLayout, AuthLayout
  core/
    db/                # idb schema, versions, outbox table
    sync/              # sync engine, status store, conflict handling
    api/               # HTTP client (used only by sync)
    auth/              # session, current user, roles

    reports/
    dashboard/         # owner home + daily digest
  types/               # entity types (mirror of section 12)
```

Each feature folder follows the same shape:

```text
features/trips/

## 8. Routing and navigation

After login, the user lands on their role's home. A user with several roles picks one from a role switcher; the route guard checks the active role on every navigation.

**Navigation pattern:** bottom tab bar (max 5 tabs) on phones for rider, cashier and staff; side nav on tablet and desktop for owner.

| Role            | Home                    | Tabs / nav                                                                                  |

## 9. Screen inventory

40 screens, login included, across four role areas. Each lists what it shows and its main actions; build them as empty shells first (section 14).

## 10. Key flows

Each flow lists the steps, the rules checked (section 5), and what is written locally.

### 10.1 Delivery trip

1. Cashier creates load-out: rider, round refills and quantities (BR-01). Writes trip + container movement station → rider.
2. Rider syncs, opens Today's trip.
3. Per stop: tap customer → delivered and empties prefilled from last delivery → adjust → payment type.
   - Credit: blocked if over limit or not enabled (BR-04, BR-05); rider switches to cash.
   - Borrowed container without deposit on file: prompt deposit unless waived (BR-06).
4. Confirm. Writes delivery + movements (rider → customer, customer → rider) + outbox entry. Works offline.
5. Rider taps End trip → Return summary shows expected full, empties and cash.
6. Cashier receives return: enters counted full, empties, cash.
7. Reconcile once fully synced (BR-08). Variances (BR-09) create a shortage record for owner review (BR-13).

### 10.2 Walk-in sale

1. Pick product(s) and quantity.
2. Container: own or borrowed. Borrowed requires a customer (search or quick-add) and deposit (BR-06).
3. Payment: cash, e-wallet or credit (BR-04, BR-05).
4. Confirm. Writes sale, movements, consumable deductions (BR-18), drawer entry.

### 10.3 Cashier day

1. Open drawer with opening cash.
2. Sales, collections, rider remittances and drawer expenses post to the session automatically.
3. End of day: daily container count (expected vs counted), then close drawer with cash count.
4. Variances saved against the cashier; both feed the owner digest.

### 10.4 Payroll run

1. Owner creates run: frequency and period.
2. App computes per employee: base (riders: days from reconciled trips), daily incentive (BR-10), adjustments.
3. Deductions applied in order within the cap (BR-11, BR-12); overflow shown as carried over.
4. Owner reviews, adds adjustments, finalizes (BR-14). Payslips appear under Me. Payroll expense posts.

### 10.5 Advance or loan

1. Employee requests amount (and term for loans) from Me.
2. Owner sees request in Approvals with a preview: interest, installment per pay run, schedule.
3. Owner attaches signed authorization (photo) and releases (BR-15). Release posts as expense.
4. Installments deduct in each payroll run; early payoff recalculates interest (BR-16).

### 10.6 Void or correction

1. From any record: Request void → reason required (BR-03).
2. At or under threshold: applied, logged. Above: goes to Approvals.
3. Approved void writes reversing entries; the original stays visible, marked void.

### 10.7 Credit payment

1. Rider (on delivery) or cashier opens customer → sees balance and aging.
2. Enter amount (partial allowed) → confirm. Payment counts in that person's cash.

## 11. Offline and sync

All roles work offline; riders depend on it. Records are append-only (BR-02), so sync is mostly pushing new entries, with few true conflicts.

**Local data**

- IndexedDB holds the records each role needs: rider gets own trips, customers, products, prices, credit balances; cashier and owner get everything for the store.
- Every record gets a client-generated UUID and `createdAt` at write time, so offline entries are valid before sync.
- `outbox` table: one row per write (entity, payload, attempts, last error).

**Sync engine**

- Push: send outbox in creation order; remove each row on server acknowledgement. Retry with backoff on failure.
- Pull: fetch changes since the last cursor per table; upsert locally.
- Triggers: app start, network regained, every few minutes while online, and a manual Sync now button.
- Before a trip starts, the rider app forces a sync so credit balances and prices are fresh.

**Conflicts**

- Server wins on reference data (prices, settings, credit limits).
- A pushed record the server rejects (e.g. credit over limit because of a sale elsewhere) is kept, marked **Rejected** with the reason, and shown in the owner's Approvals and at reconciliation.
- Records are never silently dropped.

**What the user sees**

| State      | Indicator                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| All synced | Green dot, last sync time                  |
| Pending    | Amber badge with count of unsynced entries |
| Offline    | Grey badge "Offline — saved on this phone" |
| Rejected   | Red badge; tap for details                 |

**Guards**

- Trip reconciliation disabled while that trip has unsynced entries (BR-08).
- Payroll runs, approvals and settings require online; screens say so instead of failing.
- Logout blocked while the outbox is not empty, to prevent data loss.

**PWA**

- Installable, app shell cached, updates prompt to reload once the outbox is empty.

## 12. Frontend data contract

The entities and actions the frontend expects. This is the input for the backend spec, not the database design. All ids are UUIDs; money is integer centavos; times are ISO timestamps.

**Entities**

| Entity            | Key fields                                                                                                                |

Computed by the backend (frontend shows, never stores as truth): holdings, balances, aging, expected counts, reconciliation variances, pay lines, loan schedules.

## 13. UI and design guidelines

Design for a rider on a cheap Android phone, in sun, with one hand. Everything else scales up from there.

**Layout**

- Mobile-first; owner screens add a side nav and wider tables at 1024 px and up.
- One primary action per screen, fixed at the bottom within thumb reach.
- Forms in bottom sheets for quick entries; full pages only for long forms.

**Touch and input**

- Tap targets at least 48 px; steppers (− / +) and a number pad for quantities, never a tiny text field.
- Prefill wherever history allows (last delivered, last empties).
- Confirm step shows totals in large type before saving.

**Speed**

- Target: a delivery logged in 5 taps or fewer.
- Lists virtualized; customer search works on local data, instant.
- Initial JS bundle kept small (route-level code splitting); test on a low-end Android device.

**Visual**

- High contrast for outdoor use; body text 16 px minimum, totals 24 px+.
- Status colours only with meaning: green synced / OK, amber pending / due soon, red rejected / variance / overdue. Always paired with text or an icon.
- Light and dark theme via Tailwind tokens.
- Money as ₱1,234.00; dates as 27 Sep 2026; times in Asia/Manila.

**Feedback**

- Every save confirms with a toast that says saved locally or synced.
- Blocked actions explain why in one line (e.g. "Credit limit reached — take cash").
- Empty states say what to do next.

**Language**

- English and Filipino labels via vue-i18n; plain words, no accounting jargon on staff screens.

**Accessibility**

- Labels on every input, visible focus, screen-reader names on icon buttons.

## 14. Skeleton build checklist

The skeleton is done when every route renders its shell for the right role, running on mock local data, with no backend.

**Foundation**

- [ ] Vite + Vue 3 + TypeScript + Tailwind + Pinia + Vue Router scaffold
- [ ] Folder structure per section 7
- [ ] vite-plugin-pwa installed; app installs and loads offline
- [ ] vue-i18n with `en` and `fil` files, keys only
- [ ] Money and date helpers (centavos, Asia/Manila)

**App shell**

- [ ] Layouts: Owner (side nav), Cashier, Rider, Staff (bottom tabs), Auth
- [ ] Mock login with role picker; role switcher for multi-role users
- [ ] Route guards by role; redirect to role home
- [ ] All routes from section 8 registered, each rendering a titled placeholder

**Core UI kit**

- [ ] Button, Field, Select, Stepper, NumberPad, BottomSheet, Dialog, Toast, EmptyState, DataTable, SyncBadge, MoneyText

**Data layer stubs**

- [ ] idb schema for section 12 entities + outbox table
- [ ] Seed script with mock employees, customers, products, prices, containers
- [ ] One repository per feature with typed read/write stubs
- [ ] Sync engine stub: status store and SyncBadge wired, push/pull as no-ops
- [ ] Business rules BR-01 to BR-20 as pure function signatures with unit test placeholders

**First screens to flesh out** (proves the pattern end to end)

- [ ] Rider: Today's trip → Log delivery → Return summary, fully offline on mock data
- [ ] Cashier: Walk-in sale with borrowed container and deposit prompt
- [ ] Owner: Settings screen for global defaults

**Open items before implementation**

- Default values marked TBD in section 3.
- Payment types: confirm cash, e-wallet and credit are the full list.
